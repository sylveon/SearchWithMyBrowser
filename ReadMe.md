# SearchWithMyBrowser

Since April 28th, Cortana opens searches only in Microsoft Edge to prevent users from using another search engine than Bing.  
SearchWithMyBrowser is a little utility that associates itself with the `microsoft-edge:` protocol, used by Cortana to open Edge. After parsing the request to make sure it's a valid URL, it will redirect it to your default browser.

## Installing the program

Go to the [releases section](https://github.com/charlesmilette/SearchWithMyBrowser/releases) to download the latest version. Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the instructions.  
If for any particular reason you need to test the executable you builded yourself, you can either make the same registry entries than the installer or just overwrite the file created by the installer.

## Building the program

First, make sure you have the latest release of [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) installed in the default location.  
To build the whole project, run the `Make.cmd` file at the root of the repository. You can also build subcomponents by running the `Make.cmd` file present in their subfolder.
